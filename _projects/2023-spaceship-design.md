A heat exchanger is a refrigeration system that transfers energy between fluids at different temperatures while not allowing them to mix. The most common heat exchangers are the Evaporator and the Condensor. For this project it will be focused on the counterflow condensor heat exchanger. High temperature refrigerant vapor from the compressor flows in one direction and the cooling air flows in the opposite direction. The condensor performs two important functions, desuperheating which reduces the superheated refrigerant vapor temperature. And condensation which rejects latent heat and then turns it into high pressure liquid. Then the refrigerant flows into the expansion valve. The purpose of this machine is to transfer thermal energy from the indoor air which is the refrigerant. Also to enable minimum energy input for to make an efficient phase change for heat absorbtion.

To improve this system we will analyze what increasing the evaporator surface area would do. First the heat transfer rate would increase due to a larger area inducing more convection and more refrigerant contact. Secondly the refrigerant air more closley follows air temperature. Improved heat transfer leads to the refrigerant reaching its desired superheat. Also a possible lower evaporating temperature which increases cooling capabilities. And lastly an improved coefficient of performance (COP), because the compressor workload dosen't have to increase and if the QL while the compressor work stays the same than the COP will increase.
