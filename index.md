## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Douglas Antaky, and I am a student athlete at Cornell University where I am studying Operations Research and Information Engineering. 

I am passionate about learning how to use what I learn from my classes and applying it to study the stock market. I am interested in learning how I am able to use mathematics and statistics to solve problems and understand patterns seen throughout our everyday lives. I also enjoy going on hikes and exploring the outdoors.
